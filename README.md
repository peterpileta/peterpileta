# Hi there 👋

I'm a front end developer who is passionate about creating beautiful and functional web applications. I have skills in **react**, **nextjs**, **redux**, **css**, **js**, **git**, and **vite**.

I'm currently learning new technologies and best practices to improve my coding skills and portfolio. I'm also looking for opportunities to collaborate with other developers and contribute to open source projects.

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or feedback. You can also follow me on  [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-pileta).

Thanks for visiting my profile! 😊
